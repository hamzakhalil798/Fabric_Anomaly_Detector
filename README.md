# Fabric_Anomaly_Detector
This is A Flask App that uses DRÃ†M (Discriminatively Trained Reconstruction Embedding for Surface Anomaly Detection) is a method for detecting anomalies in surfaces, such as defects or damage, using a combination of reconstruction and classification techniques.
For now its trained on only one class that is 'Fabric', but I'll be adding all the classes present in MVtec Dataset.
